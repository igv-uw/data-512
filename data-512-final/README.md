# DATA 512 final project
The objective of this project is to analyze the relationships between public transport quality and income distribution in Santiago, Chile.

## Motivation for the project and research question
In the city of Santiago, nearly 30% of the population uses public transport on a daily basis. It is commonly attributed that people with lower incomes use public transport disproportionally more than other groups, however, it is also said that in the areas where these habitants live, the public transport has a worse coverage and a lower frequency of service. I am particularly interested in verifying these claims and to analyze which communities are being left out by public transport.  
My research question for the project is going to be **"Is the quality of the public transit service correlated with the average wealth of the people that live in the area?"**
